GIT Basics homework
Part 1
1.Install GIT on your workstation
2.Setup git: change your global configs (add name and email, setup core text editor). 
3.Create account on GitLab
4.Generate ssh-key and integrate it with GitLab.
5.Create new project on GitLab.
6.Clone project to your workstation.
7.Create .gitignore file. Include .gitignore in its own list. Try to use different patterns in .gitignore file (see in lecture) to make invisible for git some local files that should not be commited. Check that files mentioned in .gitignore file shouldn’t be visible via executing git status command.
Part 2
1.Open git console in root directory of your project and make next steps.
2.Do all your experiments in folder “task1 –git pracrice I”.
3.Create empty readme.txt file.
4.Make init commit.
5.Create develop branch and checkout on it.
6.Create index.html empty file. Commit.
7.Create branch with name“images”. Checkouton it. Add images folder withsomeimages inside it. Commit.
8.Change your index.html. Add imagessource inside it. Commit.
9.Go back to develop branch.
10.Create branch with name“styles”.Checkouton it. Add styles folder with styles source inside it. Commit.
11.Change your index.html. Commit.
12.Go to develop branch.
13.Merge two new branches into develop using git merge command. Resolve conflict if it appear.Do it in next sequence:•merge “images” into “develop”•merge “styles” into “develop”
14.Do not delete any branches!
15.Merge develop into master.
16.Checkout to develop branch and repeat 7-15 items once more(use names “images2”, “styles2” for new branches).Now use git rebasecommand instead of git mergein step 13.
Do rebase in next sequence:
•rebase “images2” onto “develop”
•rebase (fast-forward) “develop” onto “images2”
•rebase “styles2” onto ‘’develop’
•rebase (fast-forward) “develop” onto “styles2”
17.Merge develop into master.

NOTE: As a result master/develop branchesshould containall commits that were done in process
Part 3
1.Try to inspect your repository with git log command. Use different options with this command (git log --help).
2.Push all your changes with allyour branches toorigin(git push origin --all).
3.Execute command “git reflog“ and save it content somewhere (not in repository) with filename “GIT_Basics_homework_I.txt”.

Additional task (*)

Write common sidesand differences between mergeand rebasecommands.
Write pros and cons for mergeand rebase. Describe situations for preferably usage of these commands.Use additional materials for this task.
